#FAQ
faq.0.question = How can I use Lawliet?
faq.0.answer = It's very simple! Just invite the bot into your server. After that, write "{PREFIX}help" in order to open a menu where you can browse every command Lawliet has to offer, including explanations and examples.
faq.1.question = What permissions does Lawliet require in order to work properly?
faq.1.answer = The bot always needs to be able to read and write messages and to embed links, some commands might require more than that. "Add Reactions" and "Use External Emojis" are also recommended. If you try to execute a command even though the bot is missing the required permissions, then you will get notified.
faq.2.question = Command executions should only be allowed in certain channels, how can I do that?
faq.2.answer = Just run the command "{PREFIX}whitelist". There you can specify the channels in which your server members should be able to execute bot commands. All other channels will be excluded.
faq.3.question = How can I turn off NSFW commands?
faq.3.answer = You can use the command "{PREFIX}cman" to turn off individual commands or whole categories for the whole server. But generally speaking, users can only use NSFW commands if your server even offers any NSFW channels in the first place.
faq.4.question = The bot doesn't react to my commands
faq.4.answer = This can have many reasons:\n\n- The bot can't access the current channel. This issue occurs mostly in channels which require a specific role in order to be accessed\n- The prefix has been changed. In order to switch back to the default prefix, just write "@Lawliet#5480 prefix L."\n- The bot is temporarily offline
faq.5.question = "The role/s (...) can not be managed due to missing permissions!"
faq.5.answer = This basically means that the bot is unable to manage your specified roles. In order to solve the issue, you need to go to the server settings and move all of the corresponding roles below the Lawliet role.
faq.6.question = I cannot warn / kick / ban / mute other members because I'm missing permissions
faq.6.answer = You can only interact with other members who exclusively have roles which are placed lower than your mod role. Esthetic roles like color roles should never be higher than any kind of server staff role!
faq.7.question = Why don't I get any fish in the fishery? (For message and voice activity)
faq.7.answer = The bot uses several mechanisms in order to prevent spamming as best as possible. If you happen to get no fish, then the anti spam protection might be the reason. Just interact with other server members and the bot will soon start giving you fish again.
faq.8.question = Why do I lose fish in the fishery?
faq.8.answer = The "Recent Fish Gains" refer to the last 7 days and can therefore be reduced at any time, this is completely normal. You should be aware that your fish and your recent fish gains are two separate values.
faq.9.question = How can I offer roles in the fishery and how can I specify the order?
faq.9.answer = You can add the roles with "{PREFIX}fisheryroles". The order of the roles is based on the position of the roles within the server role hierarchy. Roles that are placed further down are offered earlier.
faq.10.question = How can I automize commands like "{PREFIX}animenews" / "{PREFIX}r34"?
faq.10.answer = You can do it with the alerts command. Just run "{PREFIX}alerts" in the corresponding channel and then navigate through the menu.
faq.11.question = What are the minimum / maximum values of the exchange rate in the fishery?
faq.11.answer = In theory, the exchange rate can fluctuate between 50 and 150 coins per fish. Mostly it is around 100 coins per fish though.
faq.12.question = How can I manage my own Auto Channel?
faq.12.answer = You can manage your own Auto Channel via the Discord client by pressing the gear icon on the right side. Depending on the server setting, you might need to activate two-factor authentication in your account beforehand.
faq.13.question = How can I report bugs?
faq.13.answer = If you find any bugs, please report them in the Lawliet support server, so the developer can look into them and fix them.
faq.14.question = Why does Lawliet show underaged characters in nsfw commands?
faq.14.answer = Most nsfw commands use external providers like rule34.xxx, e621.net, and so on. Lawliet automatically filters out content which is tagged as lolicon / shotacon / cub, but because it's user generated content, there is always the slight possibility that posts are not tagged accordingly. If you encounter such content, please go to the original source and report it there.
